# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a Python-based **Movie Recommendation System** that leverages machine learning techniques and data analysis to recommend movies to users based on their preferences.

---

## Features

- **Content-Based Recommendations:** Suggests movies similar to the one the user likes by analyzing attributes like genre, cast, director, etc.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Hybrid System:** Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.
- Interactive user interface for selecting movies and displaying recommendations.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the following datasets:

1. **Movies Dataset** (`tmdb_5000_movies.csv`): Contains metadata about movies, including title, genres, overview, and production details.
2. **Credits Dataset** (`tmdb_5000_credits.csv`): Contains information about cast and crew.

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (for web interface, if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for experimentation)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation.git
cd movie-recommendation
```

### 2. Add the Dataset
Place the `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` files in the root folder of the repository.

## Recommendation Methodology

### Content-Based Filtering
1. Preprocess the dataset by extracting relevant features (e.g., genres, keywords, cast).
2. Vectorize text data using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.
3. Compute similarity using cosine similarity.
4. Suggest movies similar to the input movie.

### Collaborative Filtering
1. Build a user-item matrix.
2. Use matrix factorization (e.g., SVD) or neural networks to predict user ratings.
3. Suggest movies based on predicted ratings.

### Hybrid Model
Combine the predictions from content-based and collaborative systems for better accuracy.

## Example

To get recommendations for a movie like *Inception*:
1. Enter "Inception" in the input.
2. The system will return a list of similar movies such as "Interstellar," "The Matrix," etc.
